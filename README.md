# Mask-GRPO

### Update on Nov 9th:

We release the inference code of our model on [GenEval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval)! Play our model freely!

To get start, we recommend that you first prepare the environment following [Show-O](https://github.com/showlab/Show-o), and save its model at your local.

Then, modify the first 4 lines in the main function of `code/geneval.py`, and run                  
```
bash code/geneval.sh
```
The evaluation process keeps the same with [GenEval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval).

We are packing our training code now. In fact some functions of training are in `code/models/modeling_showo.py`.

### Update on Oct 26th:

We released our [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/happyyifu/Mask-GRPO/blob/main/mycheckpoint.pth)!

We are packing our code now. We will release it soon.
